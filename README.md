Encrypt and Decrypt Text Using the Caesar Cipher This repository contains a Python program that allows you to encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple and well-known encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet.

# Features:
* Encrypt a message using a customizable shift value.
* Decrypt a message with the same shift value.
* Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Keeps non-alphabet characters unchanged.

# Usage:
* Input a message and specify a shift value to encrypt or decrypt the text.
* Easily integrate or modify the program for learning or personal use.

# Getting Started:
* Clone this repository and run the caesar_cipher.py file to start encrypting or decrypting your messages!
